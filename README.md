dsa-inventory-project
=====================

Team Project for ESC DSA Course Fall 2014

To compile and run the program, navigate to the src directory and execute the 
command javac inventory/NamesOfFiles.java. This will compile all files in the
"inventory" package (provided you actually list all the source files you want
to compile or a wildcard character to compile all of them).

To then run the program, execute the command java inventory.InventoryApp.

Currently, to test the program, compile only the ItemRecord.java and
InventoryApp.java files. This README will be updated as more of the source
files are completed implementing the container structures and the application
is fleshed out to provide additional functionality.
